### Deductions

I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.

### Comments

I had a hard time getting the plugins to work.

Also, I think my developer tools is messed up because the preview of what it should look like isn't what it looks like when I close out of the developer tools. I'm not sure how to fix that. I chose not to use them as much for this project for that reason. 

I really like the look of this though!
